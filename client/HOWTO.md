1. Create React App and install packages
    create-react-app workoutlog     -downloads react/creates files
    npm install reactstrap bootstrap -downloads bootstrap

2. Delete unnecessary files and code in App.js template. Simple import of react, empty function app with    Div's

3. Run the application
    npm start. Should get a success message with no errors

4. Set up basic components. 
    Most exercises have started with a set up of navbar or sidebar.
    Link it back to App.js

5. Handling a Token
    Add token handling to App.js so you can pass it down to all child elements. Goes inside main App function but before the return

6. Build more components. Add the import and render file to App.js
